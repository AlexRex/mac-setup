# macOS Sierra Dev Setup

This document describes how I set up my developer environment on macOS for web development.

The steps below were tested on **macOS Sierra**.

- [System setup](#system-setup)
- [System preferences](#system-preferences)
- [Consolas](#consolas)
- [Source Code Pro](#source-code-pro)
- [Beautiful terminal](#beautiful-terminal)
- [MySQL](#mysql)
- [MongoDB](#mongodb)
- [Redis](#redis)
- [Projects folder](#projects-folder)
- [Apps Included](#apps-included)
- [Credits](#credits)

## TO-DO

- Change Sublime for Atom.
- Add [bash-completions](http://blog.alextorres.me/2016/07/13/bash-completions-osx/)

## System setup

We're going to run a script to setup the basic software for development, plus some tweaks and tools.

First we need to install the xcode command line tools and then restart, so open a terminal and:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

Restart and then:
```shell
/usr/bin/python -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexRex/mac-setup/master/setup.py)"
```

And just follow the instructions. :)

## System preferences

If this is a new computer, there are a couple tweaks I like to make to the System Preferences. Feel free to follow these, or to ignore them, depending on your personal preferences.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Dock > Animation

## Consolas

I really like the Consolas font for coding. Being a Microsoft (!) font, it is not installed by default. Since we're going to be looking at a lot of terminal output and code, let's install it now.

There are two ways we can install it. If you bought **Microsoft Office for Mac**, install that and Consolas will be installed as well.

If you don't have Office, follow these steps:

    $ brew install cabextract
    $ cd ~/Downloads
    $ mkdir consolas
    $ cd consolas
    $ curl -O http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/5/a/f5a3df76-d856-4a61-a6bd-722f52a5be26/PowerPointViewer.exe
    $ cabextract PowerPointViewer.exe
    $ cabextract ppviewer.cab
    $ open CONSOLA*.TTF

And click **Install Font**. Thanks to Alexander Zhuravlev for his [post](http://blog.ikato.com/post/15675823000/how-to-install-consolas-font-on-mac-os-x).

## Source Code Pro

Another font very awesome.

Downoad it from its [repo](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases).

Then in the folder OTF select all the *.otf files and open them. (Tip: Use <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd> Enter </kbd> to open files).

## Beautiful terminal

Since we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place. What follows might seem like a lot of work, but trust me, it'll make the development experience so much better.

Let's go ahead and start by changing the font. In **iTerm > Preferences...**, under the tab **Profiles**.

Now let's add some color. I'm a big fan of the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme. It is supposed to be scientifically optimal for the eyes. I just find it pretty.

Scroll down the page and download the latest version. Unzip the archive. In it you will find the `iterm2-colors-solarized` folder with a `README.md` file, but I will just walk you through it here:

- In **iTerm2 Preferences**, under **Profiles** and **Colors**, go to **Load Presets... > Import...**, find and open the two **.itermcolors** files we downloaded.
- Go back to **Load Presets...** and select **Solarized Dark** to activate it. Voila!

**Note**: You don't have to do this, but there is one color in the **Solarized Dark** preset I don't agree with, which is *Bright Black*. You'll notice it's too close to *Black*. So I change it to be the same as *Bright Yellow*, i.e. **R 83 G 104 B 112**.

With that, open a new terminal tab (Cmd+T) and see the change! Try the list commands: `ls`, `ls -lh` (aliased to `ll`), `ls -lha` (aliased to `la`).

At this point you can also change your computer's name, which shows up in this terminal prompt. If you want to do so, go to **System Preferences** > **Sharing**. For example, I changed mine from "Nicolas's MacBook Air" to just "MacBook Air", so it shows up as `MacBook-Air` in the terminal.

Now we have a terminal we can work with!

## MySQL

### Install

Before we can use MySQL we first need to set it up with:

    $ unset TMPDIR
    $ mkdir /usr/local/var
    $ mysql_install_db --verbose --user=`whoami` --basedir="$(brew --prefix mysql)" --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql --tmpdir=/tmp

### Usage

To start the MySQL server, use the `mysql.server` tool:

    $ mysql.server start

To stop it when you are done, run:

    $ mysql.server stop

You can see the different commands available for `mysql.server` with:

    $ mysql.server --help

To connect with the command-line client, run:

    $ mysql -uroot

(Use `exit` to quit the MySQL shell.)

**Note**: By default, the MySQL user `root` has no password. It doesn't really matter for a local development database. If you wish to change it though, you can use `$ mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'`.

### MySQL Workbench

In terms of a GUI client for MySQL, I'm used to the official and free [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). But feel free to use whichever you prefer.

You can find the MySQL Workbench download [here](http://www.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/). (**Note**: It will ask you to sign in, you don't need to, just click on "No thanks, just start my download!" at the bottom.)

## MongoDB

[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is a popular [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database.

### Usage

In a terminal, start the MongoDB server:

    $ mongod

In another terminal, connect to the database with the Mongo shell using:

    $ mongo

I'll let you refer to MongoDB's [Getting Started](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/getting-started/) guide for more!

## Redis

[Redis](http://redis.io/) is a blazing fast, in-memory, key-value store, that uses the disk for persistence. It's kind of like a NoSQL database, but there are a lot of [cool things](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html) that you can do with it that would be hard or inefficient with other database solutions. For example, it's often used as session management or caching by web apps, but it has many other uses.

### Usage

Start a local Redis server using the default configuration settings with:

    $ redis-server

For advanced usage, you can tweak the configuration file at `/usr/local/etc/redis.conf` (I suggest making a backup first), and use those settings with:

    $ redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

In another terminal, connect to the server with the Redis command-line interface using:

    $ redis-cli

I'll let you refer to Redis' [documentation](http://redis.io/documentation) or other tutorials for more information.

## Elasticsearch

As it says on the box, [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) is a "powerful open source, distributed real-time search and analytics engine". It uses an HTTP REST API, making it really easy to work with from any programming language.

You can use elasticsearch for such cool things as real-time search results, autocomplete, recommendations, machine learning, and more.

### Install

Elasticsearch runs on Java, so check if you have it installed by running:

```bash
java -version
```

If Java isn't installed yet, a window will appear prompting you to install it. Go ahead and click "Install".

Next, install elasticsearch with:

```bash
$ brew install elasticsearch
```

**Note**: Elasticsearch also has a `plugin` program that gets moved to your `PATH`. I find that too generic of a name, so I rename it to `elasticsearch-plugin` by running (will need to do that again if you update elasticsearch):

```bash
$ mv /usr/local/bin/plugin /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch-plugin
```

Below I will use `elasticsearch-plugin`, just replace it with `plugin` if you haven't followed this step.

As you guessed, you can add plugins to elasticsearch. A popular one is [elasticsearch-head](http://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/), which gives you a web interface to the REST API. Install it with:

```bash
$ elasticsearch-plugin --install mobz/elasticsearch-head
```

### Usage

Start a local elasticsearch server with:

```bash
$ elasticsearch -f
```

(The `-f` option tells it to run in the foreground, so you can stop it with `Ctrl+C`.)

Test that the server is working correctly by running:

```bash
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/'
```

If you installed the elasticsearch-head plugin, you can visit its interface at `http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/`.

Elasticsearch's [documentation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/) is more of a reference. To get started, I suggest reading some of the blog posts linked on this [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11593035/beginners-guide-to-elasticsearch/11767610#11767610).

## Projects folder

This really depends on how you want to organize your files, but I like to put all my version-controlled projects in `~/Dev`. Other documents I may have, or things not yet under version control, I like to put in `~/Dropbox` (if you have Dropbox installed), or `~/Documents`.
